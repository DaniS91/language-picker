    <h1>Which programming language is right for me?</h1>
    <div class="userinput">
      <form id="quiz">
        <p id="question">Which of the following three statements sounds the most correct?</p>
        <label class="radio">
          <input type="radio" name="question1" value="object" required>
          Code is a bunch of little bundles of information that interact with each other; grouping information like this makes it easier to understand.
        </label>
        <br></br>
        <label class="radio">
          <input type="radio" name="question1" value="function" required>
          Code is made up of pure mathematical functions that are unchanging and aboslute, and easy to control.
        </label>
        <br></br>
        <label class="radio">
          <input type="radio" name="question1" value="multi" required>
          Code can be represented by both of the above options, and more! I prefer to think of code as a combination of these and other ideas.
